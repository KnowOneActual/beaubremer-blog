# Security Policy

I take the security of my website and its users seriously. I welcome contributions from security researchers to help keep my services safe.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have discovered a security vulnerability, please report it to me promptly. All security reports should be submitted through the secure contact form on my main portfolio site. (https://beaubremer.com/#contact) on my main site.

Please include a detailed description of the vulnerability, including:
* The URL where the vulnerability was discovered.
* A detailed description of the issue and the potential impact.
* Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.

I will make every effort to respond to your report in a timely manner.

## Scope

This policy applies to the following domains:
* `beaubremer.com`
* `blog.beaubremer.com`

## My Pledge

I pledge not to pursue legal action against you if you act in good faith and adhere to the guidelines of this policy. I will work with you to understand and resolve the issue quickly, and I am happy to provide public acknowledgement for your contribution once the vulnerability is resolved.

Thank you for helping to keep my website secure.
