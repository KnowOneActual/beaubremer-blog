    <p>It all started with a domain name.</p>
<p>A couple of friends and I came up with <code>profitandego.com</code> years ago on a Lake Michigan beach. It perfectly captured the strange, satirical dance of modern ambition. I'd been sitting on this domain for years, and while I wanted to do something with it, I just didn't know what.</p>
<h3>The Spark: Ego as a Service (EaaS)</h3>
<p>While reading an article about SaaS, it hit me out of nowhere. The idea stuck out for its simplicity and humor: an &quot;Ego as a Service&quot; (EaaS) page. The concept was simple: a single button that, when clicked, serves up a dose of over-the-top corporate praise.</p>
<p>I put together a single-page site using HTML, Tailwind CSS for styling, and vanilla JavaScript. The goal was to make it look sleek and modern, a fun contrast to the absurdity of the content. Within a day, the first version was live, complete with affirmations like, &quot;Your strategic vision is so clear, it's practically a premonition.&quot;</p>
<h3>Expanding the Joke</h3>
<p>The site was fun, but it felt like the joke could go further. That's when I came up with the idea for satirical pricing tiers. I fleshed out three plans: &quot;The Intern,&quot; &quot;The Manager,&quot; and &quot;The CEO,&quot; each offering increasingly ridiculous services, from a &quot;Like Bot&quot; to a &quot;Rival Roast Report.&quot; This added a new layer to the satire, mimicking the SaaS world we've become so familiar with.</p>
<h3>The Logo Saga</h3>
<p>Every good (or in this case, fake) company needs a logo, and this turned into a surprisingly tricky part of the project. After a few initial designs didn't quite fit the site's aesthetic, I decided to create something new. The &quot;Ascending Bar Chart&quot; felt like the perfect visual gag for &quot;profit.&quot;</p>
<p>However, getting it to look right on the page was a challenge. After struggling with image padding and alignment, I landed on a much better solution: embedding the logo directly into the HTML as an SVG. I'd never done this before, but I remembered read about it a couple of months back. With a little help from Google, I figured it out. This meant it would load instantly, scale perfectly, and I'd never have to worry about broken image links. It was a great reminder that sometimes the most robust solution is also the simplest.</p>
<h3>A Dose of Reality: Securing the Site</h3>
<p>With the site up and running, I decided to run it through a security scanner out of curiosity. The result? A failing grade.</p>
<p>While the site is just for fun, it was a perfect learning opportunity. The report from <a href="https://securityheaders.com">securityheaders.com</a> showed I was missing key instructions that tell browsers how to handle my site's content securely. Since the site is hosted with Cloudflare, the fix was elegant and simple: I created a <code>_headers</code> file.</p>
<p>This single file allowed me to define all the necessary security headers, like Content-Security-Policy and X-Frame-Options, keeping the configuration right alongside my code. After pushing the file, a new scan confirmed the fix: an &quot;A+&quot; rating!</p>
<h3>An Unexpected Side Effect</h3>
<p>Implementing a strong Content-Security-Policy (CSP) had one immediate side effect: the &quot;Validate Me&quot; button stopped working. This wasn't a bug, but rather the CSP doing its job perfectly. It blocked the &quot;inline&quot; JavaScript I had originally written directly in my <code>index.html</code> file.</p>
<p>The solution was to refactor the code. I moved the JavaScript from the <code>index.html</code> file into its own <code>script.js</code> file. After updating the HTML to reference the new external script, the button was back in business, and the site was more secure and better organized for it.</p>
<h3>Why Bother?</h3>
<p>As the site's <a href="https://github.com/KnowOneActual/profitandego_website/blob/main/README.md">README file on GitHub</a> says, this project is a playground. It's a low-stakes environment where I can try out new ideas, test Cloudflare features, and just have fun building something. It's a reminder that not every project needs to be a serious venture. Sometimes, the best way to learn is by building something for the joy of it.</p>
