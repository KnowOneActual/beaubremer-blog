    <p>We've all seen it online or heard it in a meeting. Just when you thought the &quot;chess, not checkers&quot; cliché had finally retired, its over-the-top successor arrives: the person claiming to play &quot;5D chess.&quot;</p>
<p>The boast is that they're not just thinking a few moves ahead; they're operating on a level that involves time travel and alternate realities. They want you to believe their strategy is so advanced, it's unfolding across dimensions we can't even see.</p>
<p>It’s a fun, sci-fi concept, but let's be honest: it's a meaningless escalation. It takes the flawed logic of the original phrase and pushes it into absurdity.</p>
<h3>Complexity for Its Own Sake</h3>
<p>In a previous post <a href="https://blog.beaubremer.com/posts/are_you_playing_chess_v2/">The Tell-Tale Cliché: Why Chess, Not Checkers Misses the Mark</a>, I made the case for checkers, a game whose simple rules hide a staggering amount of strategic depth. The beauty of a game like that, or real chess, is in mastering the complexity within a clear, defined system.</p>
<p>The &quot;5D chess&quot; boast does the opposite. It suggests that real genius isn't found in mastering a system, but in making it so convoluted that it becomes incomprehensible. The goal seems to be complexity for its own sake.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing: adding more dimensions doesn't make you a better strategist. It just makes the game impossible to play. Real-world strategy isn't about inventing fictional timelines to navigate. It's about making smart decisions in the one, messy reality we all share.</p>
<h3>The Tell-Tale Sign of a Non-Strategist</h3>
<p>So, what does this tell us? When someone boasts about playing 5D chess, they're often doing the exact opposite of what a genuine strategist does.</p>
<ul>
<li>A true strategist seeks clarity. They cut through the noise to find the best path forward.</li>
<li>The &quot;5D chess&quot; player creates noise. They wrap their ideas in jargon to seem more profound than they are.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s a clever smokescreen, really. It’s a way to avoid defending a plan by retreating into a fog of nonsense. After all, how can you question a strategy that's happening in another dimension?</p>
<p>Ultimately, it's the same move as looking down on checkers. It's using a catchphrase to claim a level of genius without having to demonstrate it. It's an attempt to win by declaring you're playing a superior game that no one else can see.</p>
<p>Look, real strategic thinking is hard enough right here in our own dimension. It takes focus, discipline, and a deep understanding of the actual rules of the game. The most effective people aren't the ones inventing new realities; they're the ones who master the one we're in.</p>
<p>So, let others have their multiverses. The best way to win is to simply play the board that's right in front of you.</p>
