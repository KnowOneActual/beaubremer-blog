    <p>Ever wondered what goes on behind the scenes when you interact with a website? Let's dive into a common challenge in web development and my journey to build a useful tool, even when my initial plans hit a few snags.</p>
<p>Hey everyone! I'm sharing a glimpse behind the scenes of my latest web development project. If you've poked around my site lately, you might have noticed a shiny new &quot;Network Latency Monitor&quot; in my <a href="https://beaubremer.com/#my_projects">My Projects</a>. It’s not just a tool; it’s a story about a great idea, a few head-scratching problems, and the beautiful mess of trial and error that makes development so rewarding (and occasionally, frustrating!).</p>
<h3>The Spark: A Speed Test with &quot;Wow Factor&quot;</h3>
<p>Initially, I had this neat idea: a network speed test. I thought, &quot;How cool would it be to have a built-in speed checker right on my site?&quot; It felt like a fantastic way to showcase my developing web development skills, my understanding of network principles, and just add a little bit of that interactive &quot;wow factor.&quot; I drafted up a client-side version using JavaScript, complete with progress bars and even parallel connections for downloads and uploads. If you'd like to check it out <a href="https://beaubremer.com/speed_test">Network Speed Test</a></p>
<p>The initial results? Well, they were... interesting. My script would report a download speed of around 4 Mbps, while a commercial service like Speedtest.net would confidently tell me I was cruising at 400 Mbps! Clearly, something was off.</p>
<h3>Hitting the Wall: Why My Speed Test Wasn't Usable</h3>
<p>After some troubleshooting, I realized the core limitation: building a truly accurate speed test with purely client-side JavaScript is incredibly difficult. Commercial speed tests utilize dedicated, high-performance servers distributed globally and employ complex techniques to thoroughly test your connection's capabilities. My simple script, hitting generic public endpoints like <code>httpbin.org</code>, just couldn't give me the results I was looking for.</p>
<p>It became clear: for all its &quot;wow factor,&quot; if the numbers weren't accurate, the tool wasn't truly &quot;usable.&quot; And if a tool isn't usable, it probably shouldn't be on the front page of your site!</p>
<h3>A Pivot! From Speed to Stability: The Network Latency Monitor</h3>
<p>So, I had to make a decision. Scrap the idea entirely? Or pivot? I chose to pivot. Instead of chasing elusive bandwidth numbers, I decided to build a tool that <em>could</em> be accurate and useful within my constraints: a <strong>Network Latency Monitor</strong>.</p>
<p>The idea was simple: instead of measuring <em>how fast</em> data flows, let’s measure <em>how quickly</em> it responds and if it’s available. This highlights different, but equally important, networking skills – those related to troubleshooting, availability, and responsiveness. Latency, the time it takes for a signal to travel from one point to another, is a crucial indicator of network responsiveness and a great way to assess connectivity.</p>
<h3>The Journey Continues: New Code, New Headaches (Totally Normal!)</h3>
<p>Building the latency monitor wasn’t a straight line from idea to completion, either. This is where the &quot;trial and error&quot; comes in – and why it's so vital in development!</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Silent Startup:</strong> My initial draft of the monitor wouldn't even start checking the default sites automatically. A quick dive into the console revealed a simple JavaScript error: <code>this.startMonitoringAll is not a function</code>. A quick rearrangement of code, and it was alive!
<ul>
<li><em>What I Learned:</em> The browser console is your first and best friend for catching those tricky JavaScript errors right when your page loads. Always check it!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Invisible Wall (CSP):</strong> Once it was running, the default <code>https://</code> sites were showing as &quot;Down.&quot; The console, my best friend during these times, screamed &quot;Content Security Policy (CSP) blocking!&quot; My <code>netlify.toml</code> file had a <code>connect-src</code> directive that was too strict, preventing my own site from connecting to external domains like Google or Cloudflare. This required a small but crucial tweak to my Netlify configuration, expanding the <code>connect-src</code> to allow all <code>https:</code> connections.
<ul>
<li><em>What I Learned:</em> Content Security Policy is a powerful browser security feature. While essential for protection, it's also a common reason for external resource loading issues and requires careful configuration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Mixed-Up Protocols:</strong> Next, I hit a snag with <code>http://</code> versus <code>https://</code> endpoints. My monitor, running on a secure <code>https://</code> site, was correctly blocking insecure <code>http://</code> requests (thank you, browser security!). But I also realized that if I tried to add <code>http://</code> URLs while testing locally (where my local server was <code>http://</code>), those <code>http://</code> URLs worked, but <code>https://</code> ones sometimes failed. This was a confusing dance between local environment behavior and deployed site behavior. The solution: stick firmly to <code>https://</code> for external monitoring and be very clear with users about this limitation.
<ul>
<li><em>What I Learned:</em> Always be mindful of protocol differences (<code>http</code> vs. <code>https</code>) and how they behave in both local development and deployed environments. Browser security models are designed to keep users safe, even if they occasionally make development a little trickier!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Reappearing Act:</strong> Even after successfully deleting endpoints, they'd pop back up on refresh. It turns out that the monitor was loading a hardcoded list of defaults every time the page loaded, overriding my changes. Implementing <code>localStorage</code> resolved this issue, allowing the monitor to remember user-added or removed endpoints.
<ul>
<li><em>What I Learned:</em> For persistent user preferences or data that should survive a page refresh, <code>localStorage</code> is a super handy browser API to remember things between sessions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>My Big Takeaway: Embrace the Process!</h3>
<p>This entire experience, from the ambitious (and slightly flawed) speed test to the fully functional latency monitor, reinforced some core beliefs about development:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You don't have to be perfect from the start.</strong> Ideas evolve, and initial approaches might not be the final ones. It's all part of the learning curve.</li>
<li><strong>Trial and error is not a sign of failure; it's the path to success.</strong> Every error message, every unexpected behavior, is a clue leading you closer to a robust solution.</li>
<li><strong>Debugging tools are your superpower.</strong> The browser console, network tab, and HAR files were invaluable in understanding exactly <em>why</em> things weren't working.</li>
<li><strong>Understanding constraints is key.</strong> Knowing the limitations of free hosting and browser security wasn't a blocker; it shaped the project into something even better.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, go ahead, check out the <a href="https://beaubremer.com/network_latency_monitor">Network Latency Monitor</a> on my site! Add a few of your favorite sites, and see how it performs. And remember, every &quot;bug&quot; is just a puzzle waiting to be solved. I'm always keen to dive into new challenges and expand my understanding of web performance!</p>
