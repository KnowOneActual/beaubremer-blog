We've all seen it online or heard it in a meeting. Just when you thought the "chess, not checkers" cliché had finally retired, its over-the-top successor arrives: the person claiming to play "5D chess."

The boast is that they're not just thinking a few moves ahead; they're operating on a level that involves time travel and alternate realities. They want you to believe their strategy is so advanced, it's unfolding across dimensions we can't even see.

It’s a fun, sci-fi concept, but let's be honest: it's a meaningless escalation. It takes the flawed logic of the original phrase and pushes it into absurdity.

### Complexity for Its Own Sake

In a previous post [The Tell-Tale Cliché: Why Chess, Not Checkers Misses the Mark](https://blog.beaubremer.com/posts/are_you_playing_chess_v2/), I made the case for checkers, a game whose simple rules hide a staggering amount of strategic depth. The beauty of a game like that, or real chess, is in mastering the complexity within a clear, defined system.

The "5D chess" boast does the opposite. It suggests that real genius isn't found in mastering a system, but in making it so convoluted that it becomes incomprehensible. The goal seems to be complexity for its own sake.

But here’s the thing: adding more dimensions doesn't make you a better strategist. It just makes the game impossible to play. Real-world strategy isn't about inventing fictional timelines to navigate. It's about making smart decisions in the one, messy reality we all share.

### The Tell-Tale Sign of a Non-Strategist

So, what does this tell us? When someone boasts about playing 5D chess, they're often doing the exact opposite of what a genuine strategist does.

* A true strategist seeks clarity. They cut through the noise to find the best path forward.
* The "5D chess" player creates noise. They wrap their ideas in jargon to seem more profound than they are.

It’s a clever smokescreen, really. It’s a way to avoid defending a plan by retreating into a fog of nonsense. After all, how can you question a strategy that's happening in another dimension?

Ultimately, it's the same move as looking down on checkers. It's using a catchphrase to claim a level of genius without having to demonstrate it. It's an attempt to win by declaring you're playing a superior game that no one else can see.

Look, real strategic thinking is hard enough right here in our own dimension. It takes focus, discipline, and a deep understanding of the actual rules of the game. The most effective people aren't the ones inventing new realities; they're the ones who master the one we're in.

So, let others have their multiverses. The best way to win is to simply play the board that's right in front of you.
