We've all been there. You're minutes away from the start of a corporate event, and someone hands you a flash drive packed with hundreds of photos. The request? "Can we get these looping on the big screen?"

That moment of quiet panic is a rite of passage in the event world. But it doesn't have to be. Instead of manually inserting, resizing, and centering every single image, you can automate the entire process. Let's walk through two fantastic ways to turn that chaotic folder of photos into a polished, professional PowerPoint slideshow.


### Method 1: The Ultimate Automation with Python (SlideWrangler)

If you find yourself tackling this task often, a Python script is your new best friend. It's fast, reusable, and does all the heavy lifting for you. To make this as easy as possible, I've created a tool called **SlideWrangler**.

**Why use a script?**



* **It's incredibly fast.** It processes hundreds of images in seconds.
* **It's smart.** SlideWrangler automatically fixes sideways photos, skips non-image files, and optimizes everything for screen display.
* **It's consistent.** Every slideshow comes out perfectly formatted, every time.

**How to get it:**

All the code and step-by-step instructions are available on GitHub. Just head over to the repository to get started.

➡️ **[Get SlideWrangler on GitHub](https://github.com/KnowOneActual/SlideWrangler)**

The README file there will walk you through the simple setup. In just a few minutes, you'll have a powerful tool ready to handle any photo dump that comes your way.


### Method 2: The Quick Fix Inside PowerPoint

If you're not ready to dive into scripting or just need a quick, one-time solution, PowerPoint has a great built-in feature that works wonders.

**Why use this method?**



* **No setup required.** Everything you need is already part of PowerPoint.
* **It's visual and intuitive.** You can see what you're doing every step of the way.
* **It's surprisingly fast.** While not as automated as the script, it's much faster than adding photos one by one.

**Here's how you do it:**



1. Open PowerPoint and go to the **Insert** tab.
2. Click on **Photo Album** and select **New Photo Album...**.
3. A new window will pop up. Click the **File/Disk...** button.
4. Navigate to the flash drive or folder with the images, select all of them (a handy shortcut is Ctrl+A), and click **Insert**.
5. In the Photo Album window, you can make a few adjustments. For a standard look, set the **Picture layout** to **Fit to slide**.
6. Click **Create**, and PowerPoint will instantly generate a new presentation with one photo on each slide.


### Which Method is Right for You?

If you're an event tech or someone who handles presentations regularly, taking a few minutes to set up **SlideWrangler** will pay off immensely in the long run. For a quick, one-off task, the built-in Photo Album feature is a lifesaver.

Either way, you're now equipped to handle that last-minute flash drive with confidence. No more frantic clicking—just a smooth, seamless slideshow, ready for the show.
