## Welcome! I'm New Here (And I Have No Idea What I'm Doing)

Well, I did it. I finally have a new online home. Welcome!

Right now, this space is a bit like me on a Monday morning: a work in progress, slightly confused, but full of potential. I'm busy behind the scenes, untangling the technical knots and figuring out how all this stuff works. (If you hear faint screaming, it's just me trying to center an image.)

I'll be adding all my previously posted articles here soon, they will show up eventually. More importantly, I've got some new ideas I'm excited to share with you once I'm sure I won't accidentally delete the entire internet.

So, have a look around, don't mind the occasional digital pothole, and thanks for being here at the very beginning. Let's get this show on the road!
