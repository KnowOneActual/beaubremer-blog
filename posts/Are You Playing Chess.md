# Are You Playing Chess, or Just Repeating Lines? The Trap of the Tired Trope

Ever been in a conversation and heard someone lean back, maybe with a knowing smile, and drop the line: "Oh, well, I'm playing chess while you're playing checkers"? It's a phrase that's almost universally used to imply a higher level of strategic thinking, a way of signaling, "I'm smarter than you," or "I'm better at this game." It gets slapped onto business decisions, personal squabbles—you name it. For some, it can feel like a condescending jab, trying to put you in your place.

We've all encountered this, right? Maybe it's a mid-level manager trying to impress in a PowerPoint presentation, or someone on social media arguing a point they barely understand. The sheer audacity of it can be grating, especially when they genuinely believe they're operating on some higher intellectual plane just by stringing together a sentence that hints at strategy.

But here's the kicker, and what's truly fascinating about this phenomenon: these "masterminds" often didn't even come up with the line themselves! They're just echoing something they heard elsewhere, thinking it makes them sound profound. It's like seeing yourself as Denzel Washington in Training Day saying, "This sh*t is chess, it ain't checkers!" Or perhaps envisioning yourself as Kobe Bryant schooling rookies with, "These young guys are playing checkers. I'm out there playing chess". Newsflash, you're probably not Denzel or Kobe.

This phrase has been around for ages. Samuel L. Jackson used it in a movie back in '94. It's become so common among entrepreneurs and business gurus that someone even wrote a whole book called Chess Not Checkers: Elevate Your Leadership Game. When you hear it, it makes you wonder if that book came with a little plastic crown so they could declare themselves king of the office.

Interestingly, even checkers, often seen as the simpler game, has an incredible depth. The possible positions in checkers amount to 500 billion billion (5×1020). And when it comes to mastery, consider Marion Tinsley, widely regarded as the greatest checkers player ever. He lost only seven games in his entire career, spanning 45 years. He was a math professor who had an incredible memory and analytical skills, able to see many moves into the future. He even beat a computer program in 1992, and later analysis showed he had played the only possible winning strategy from 64 moves out. If anyone was "playing chess," it was someone like him, mastering a game with astronomical possibilities.

The whole act of trotting out this tired, old phrase to declare how much smarter you are is, frankly, a bit of an "idiocy festival". It's not just that claiming to be a strategic genius might be a stretch; it's that you're using a borrowed, unoriginal line to make that claim. You're trying to signal your unique, high-wattage brainpower by simply repeating a cliché. It's like trying to prove you're a fashion icon by wearing the same cheap suit everyone else bought off the rack.

If you were truly that smart, wouldn't your own way of showing it naturally emerge? Wouldn't your brilliant strategy simply speak for itself? There's no need to lean on a movie quote or a popular business book to prove your point. When you try so hard to look smart by parroting phrases, you often end up looking like, well, a parrot with a thesaurus.

Ultimately, true leadership and genuine strategic thinking come from original thought and demonstrated ability, not from recycled catchphrases. Let's aim to truly play our own game, whatever that may be, and let our unique contributions do the talking.
